# 
# As businesses increasingly integrate algorithms into their operations, it becomes essential for learners to possess a structured framework to effectively solve problems using algorithms. Whether automating alerts, streamlining manual processes, or providing predictive insights, algorithms can revolutionise business efficiency and decision-making on a large scale and at a speed that surpasses human capabilities.

# In this module, we will explore a five-step framework for leveraging algorithms to **streamline business processes**. By following these steps, you will gain the necessary skills to make informed decisions, optimise processes, and achieve better outcomes in diverse business scenarios.

# 
# ## Identify the problem and define the task
# ---
# To start, we need to be able to clearly translate a problem's solution into a compatible machine learning task. A common way to identify opportunities for algorithmic implementation is by assessing pain points within one's own team or challenges faced by external stakeholders, such as clients. 
# 
# For example, a team may be spending a significant amount of time manually processing documents, or a client may be struggling with frequent errors in data entry, leading to delays and inaccuracies in their operations. These scenarios are prime examples of tasks that can be automated using algorithms.
# 
# Once a problem has been identified, we can then begin to conceptualise the most suitable algorithmic solution. Machine learning algorithms excel at handling tedious tasks that are relatively simple. Therefore it is beneficial to isolate a specific sub-task within the identified problem that can then be simplified into either a binary decision (true or false), multiple labels, continuous outcome, or be amenable to unsupervised learning.
# 
# <!-- Before we can begin to identify a suitable algorithm and move forward to the experimentation phase, we need to consider whether we have enough data to modelling the problem, and whether there is only a single source of data or multiple. The type of data collected plays a significant role in determining the type of algorithm that can be used.  -->
# 
# <!-- Other factors to consider when identifying a suitable task include the availability of data (is this data coming from one location or many?), and the frequency with which the task needs to be performed. -->

# :class: tip, dropdown
# Liaise with data engineers or cloud solution architects to access the necessary data either through a manual export or an automated pipeline. 
# 
# You may need to obtain credentials for cloud-based systems, or third-party APIs if external data is required.

# 
# Data is the lifeblood of any algorithmic solution. It is essential to collect relevant and high-quality data that accurately represents the problem domain. Depending on the nature of the problem, data can come from various sources, such as databases, APIs, or web scraping.
# 
# Once data is collected, it needs to be pre-processed. Data pre-processing is a critical step that involves cleaning, transforming, and organising the data to make it machine learning-ready i.e., suitable for analysis and model training. For example, if you plan on using a neural network, you will need to convert any categorical data into a binary form.

# 
# ## Select the right algorithm
# ---
# The algorithm serves as the core of the solution, and choosing the appropriate one requires careful consideration and experimentation. There are many ways to identify a suitable technique for a given task. One approach is to start with simpler models like traditional tree-based, distance-based, or error-based algorithms before considering more complex options like neural networks. Preliminary experimentation with a sample (of the entire dataset) using different algorithms will guide you in the right direction.

# `````{admonition} Storing models
# :class: note
# To facilitate the next steps, consider outputting your trained model/s as a **pickle file**, which provides a lightweight method to store the model and its architecture. Pickle files allow you to easily reload the trained model and make predictions on new data without having to retrain the model from scratch. 
# 
# For more information on pickle files, see [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html). 
# 
# Datacamp also have a great tutorial on the topic [here](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/pickle-python-tutorial).

# 
# Remember to evaluate the algorithm's performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques. Assessing both accuracy and computational efficiency will help in making an informed decision. Additionally, it is a good practice to consider interpretability â€” understanding how the algorithm makes predictions is crucial for gaining trust and confidence in the results.
# 
# Lastly, it should be noted that the urgency of the business problem should also be weighed against the benefits of exploring advanced algorithms, as quicker implementation with simpler models might be more practical.

# ## Implement and test in a development environment

# `````{admonition} Cloud-based technologies
# :class: note
# 
# Cloud platforms offer a range of services that can be used to build a pipeline for training and testing the model. These technologies are optimal for scalability, flexibility, and efficient processing of data.
# 
# You can use a cloud platform like [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/) or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) to set up a pipeline that automates the process of training and testing the model.
# `````
# ``````
# ---
# To bring the selected algorithm to life, the next step is to implement and test it in a development environment which involves building a pipeline using **cloud-based technologies**. See {ref}`Figure 3 <azure-ml>` for an example of a pipeline in Microsoft Azure.

# ```
# 
# This pipeline consists of pulling training data from internal databases, storing it in blob storage (or pickle format), and setting up a virtual machine to train and test the model. For deep learning techniques, a GPU-powered virtual machine may be necessary to meet memory requirements.
# 
# Once the pipeline is successfully set up, you will be able to access and utilise the machine learning model through an API endpoint. To enable practical usage, front-end developers can embed buttons or triggers within user-friendly interfaces, allowing users, clients, or stakeholders to generate predictions using the model seamlessly.

# ## Deploy to production environment and monitor performance
# ``````{margin}
# `````{admonition} Extend the pipeline for dynamic training
# :class: seealso, dropdown
# For continuous improvement and adaptation to evolving data streams, consider implementing a dynamic model training step within the pipeline. This ensures the model is regularly retrained thus reducing the risk of model staleness. 
# 
# To avoid interfering with clients during business hours, schedule model training with new data during off-peak times.
# `````
# ``````
# ---
# With the algorithm developed and tested in the development environment, the next crucial step is to deploy it to the production environment, where it can operate in real-world scenarios and provide value to the business. This transition must be carefully managed to ensure a smooth transfer and to minimise any disruptions to ongoing business operations.
# 
# To effectively monitor the algorithm's performance, you may also want to track the algorithm's output and performance through a real-time monitoring system, generating alerts for any anomalies or issues that may arise. This proactive approach allows for swift action and minimises potential negative impacts on business operations.
