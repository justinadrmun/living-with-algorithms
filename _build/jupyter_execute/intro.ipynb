    "To start, we need to be able to clearly translate a problem's solution into a compatible machine learning task. A common way to identify opportunities for algorithmic implementation is by assessing pain points within one's own team or challenges faced by external stakeholders, such as clients. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a team may be spending a significant amount of time manually processing documents, or a client may be struggling with frequent errors in data entry, leading to delays and inaccuracies in their operations. These scenarios are prime examples of tasks that can be automated using algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a problem has been identified, we can then begin to conceptualise the most suitable algorithmic solution. Machine learning algorithms excel at handling tedious tasks that are relatively simple. Therefore it is beneficial to isolate a specific sub-task within the identified problem that can then be simplified into either a binary decision (true or false), multiple labels, continuous outcome, or be amenable to unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Before we can begin to identify a suitable algorithm and move forward to the experimentation phase, we need to consider whether we have enough data to modelling the problem, and whether there is only a single source of data or multiple. The type of data collected plays a significant role in determining the type of algorithm that can be used.  -->\n",
